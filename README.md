## How to use
Change directory to your CRATE install dir

```
bin/plugin install  megastef/crate-conZole
```

Now you can access it in your browser (TextArea is now HTML based, in that way it is possible to use in future codemirror or ace editor functions)

```
http://localhost:4200/_plugin/crate-conZole/
```
